There are many news on the web that are false, misleading, morphed, misinterpreted, occurred years before and are being made viral claiming they are genuine and fresh.  We have used TfIdfVectorizer, PassiveAggressiveClassifier and other tools. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares. We took a political dataset, implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit our model. We ended up obtaining an accuracy of 92.82% in magnitude.
